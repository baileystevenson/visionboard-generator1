Capstone Project

VISION BOARD GENERATOR

I chose to create a Vision Board Generator for fun. It is a fully stacked project with Front-End files including HTML, CSS, and Main JS, and the Back-End files including a Server Folder and Index and Controller JS files. Inputs are allowed and added with Event-Listeners attached to buttons on the Front-End and pulled into the Back-End through Axios Request and saved on the Server. This Vision Board Generator is fully deployed and functional through AWS.

Experiences:

While building my Capstone project, I learned a lot and had many experiences that helped me more fully understand the process of Web Development. One of the valuable tools I learned to use while working on my project was the Inspection Tool. I was trying to figure out the spacing of my boxes in my CSS file and why they wouldn't line up. I was able to learn how to utilize the Inspect Tool on the live website, to try and figure out where in my code the spacing was being pulled from and why it was off. I used the inspect tool to highlight the area I was working on and find out where in my code it was pulling from. The inpsect tool also helped debug my code by find errors in my HTML and JS code. By using this tool I was able to find a div that I hadn't closed in my HTML file that was throwing things off, a MIME type error that needs to be fixed in my Styles Sheet, and some items that needed to be fixed in my Main JS file. Through utilization of this tool, I was able to trouble shoot, find and fix my errors.

Being a student, building a Full Stack website was a new adventure and big undertaking. I was able to build my Front-End files and have them function well, and then I was able to build my Server folder, and Index and Controller JS files. I built them with the Axios requests and a place to hard code all the inputs from the website, but I missed the step of adding the Axios request in my Main JS file to connect them and make them work together. I had to go back and add the Axios request fully into the Main JS file, to get the files from my Front-End and Back-End connected and talking with each other. It was a great experience to start from scratch and build a fully stacked, fully functioning website. I learned a lot and had a lot of frustrations and fun. :)
